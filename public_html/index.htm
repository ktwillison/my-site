                                        I built Less (available on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/less-a-tool-for-flexitarians/id1147139153?mt=8" target="_blank">App Store</a>) in order to help aspiring vegetarians and flexitarians track their meat consumption over time. While there are a range of benefits to eating less meat (from lower cholesterol to boasting rights over the smaller environmental impact of your diet), many people find it difficult to meaningfully cut down on meat consumption without adhering to a plan that robs the joy from their dining experiences. Did your friends plan an after-work BBQ on Wednesday? Too bad you only eat meat on the weekends! 
                                    <br/><br/>
                                        Enter Less, which allows you to set a rolling 7-day consumption limit, and then hold yourself to it with single-tap meal logging. The app includes plenty of breakdowns on your data over time and by meal type, as well as the ever-popular streak count for that extra motivation to stay within your target.

                                        As a final project for Stanford’s CS 229 course on Machine Learning, our team built a <a class="show-ML-page">classification model</a> for 23 common wine varietals based on the descriptors in a dataset of 30,000+ professional wine reviews. Our preliminary Naïve Bayes model exhibited high variance, which we chose to counter by simplifying the feature set, stemming the descriptors in each review (so that e.g. ‘jam’ and ‘jammy’ would map to the same feature), and then using (unsupervised) Latent Dirichlet Allocation to build a 20-category topic model in order to select the most relevant features across all categories. The learning curves from a 10-fold cross-validation indicated that the best balance between over and under-fitting the model was achieved by using the top 5,000 relevant features from the LDA analysis. 
                                    <br/><br/>
                                        The resulting Naïve Bayes model had a 68% testing accuracy for the 23 varietals in our dataset – rather impressive compared to the naïve baseline of 1/23 ≈ 4.3%. Additionally, the varietals present in the <a class="show-ML-page">categories created by the unsupervised LDA analysis</a>, as well as the salient descriptors for each, gives us a means to approximate varietal proximity, i.e. what wines are similar to each other and in what way (aroma, acidity, etc). All in all, it was a very exciting project to work on, in large part because it involved two of my favorite things: data and wine! Checkout the <a id="show-ML-pdf">writeup</a> for more juicy details.

                                        In the summer of 2015, <a href="https://civisanalytics.com/" target="_blank">Civis Analytics</a> was on the verge of launching their new data science platform. Originally a custom-built solution used to target voter outreach efforts in Obama’s 2008 and then 2012 campaigns, the analytical workflow they had created was increasingly more broadly applied to both public and private sector data challenges, and its web application front-end meant that the tool could now be used by data scientists and less skilled analysts alike. The challenge we were presented with (myself as the Product Manager, and my fellow intern <a href="http://deanarutherford.com/" target="_blank">Deana Rutherford</a> as the UI Designer) was to create an onboarding experience that would serve to orient data scientists to the tools they expected to find, as well as to introduce analysts to a potentially unfamiliar data science workflow and its associated tools. 
                                    <br/><br/>
                                        Our process started by shadowing a handful of new users through a few different tasks, e.g. importing a dataset, selecting a chunk of data using SQL on the platform, and building a model. As you might expect, this gave us a ton of insight into the new user experience, and a lot of little UI ‘bugs’ to squash in parallel with crafting the larger onboarding experience. In true d.School style, we then synthesized our observations into a rainbow of say/do/think/feel post-it notes centered around the different areas of the platform, and the connections between them (or lack thereof). Armed with these observations, we set off into a week-long Google design sprint, where we sketched, prototyped, tested and iterated our way through a few designs before creating a final spec and high-fidelity <a href="https://collaborate.uxpin.com/b3a168afd97b100acb1d9656c5984af371a3a98e#/pages/26155002" target="_blank">clickable prototype</a> to hand over to the dev team. At the end of the summer, we gave a presentation about the new user experience and our proposed onboarding walkthrough, and synthesized our findings into a digestible “customer journey map” for Civis to use in feature prioritization going forward.

                                        Hi there! I’m Kate. Born and raised in the heart of Silicon Valley, California, it comes as no surprise that many of my favorite things are the best of what my home state has to offer: great hiking, great wine, and great user-centric mobile and web applications. I enjoy analyzing a dataset almost as much as I enjoy analyzing a good glass of Old-Vine Zinfandel, and where those two passions intersect is most definitely my happy place (which might be obvious from the ‘Projects’ section above). Apart from that I love to travel – not so much for relaxing as for adventuring, learning new languages and experiencing new cultures.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                        In both my studies and my work I’ve aimed to balance crucial technical know-how with a strong user sensibility. I started learning humans and machines from the bottom up in my undergraduate years at UPenn, focusing on cognitive neuroscience and test-driven development. In my graduate education at Stanford, I built on this foundation by honing my design thinking skills at the Stanford d.School, as well as my technical toolkit through courses in machine learning, systems engineering, and iOS & web development. After earning my MS, I skipped town and decided to travel over-land from Stockholm to Saigon, through Estonia, Russia, Mongolia, China and Vietnam by train, bus, boat, and motorcycle. 4 months and 19,628 kilometers later, I’m heading back to Europe in search of my next adventure!

                                        The chart below shows a graphical representation of a Latent Dirichlet allocation model fit to our wine review dataset: the keywords most representative of each cluster appear on the right, and the rate at which reviews for a given varietal are classified as belonging to that cluster is proportional to the width of the line connecting the two. This graph is neat because it not only highlights a given wine's most telling attributes, but also along which dimensions it is similar to other wines.
